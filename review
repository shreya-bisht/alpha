                                <p >Our sweet Jones visited vet for followup. He said Jones leg is recovering well. While we cannot bring his spine back, we are making sure he is pain-free and comfortable. Great news is we found a sanctuary for Jones. Once he recovers, he will go to sanctuary to live for life. Jones is fortunate to get a sanctuary. Any donations will help Jones sanctuary fees. Please donate and help Jones go to sanctuary.
                                    When a Good Samaritan came across Jones’s lifeless body lying in the streets, without hesitation, he ran to his rescue. But, sadly, this sweet boy needed way more than simple first aid…
                                    Without seconds to spare, rescuers at Stray Animal Foundation of India were called to help get this sweet boy the extensive medical care he desperately needed. After rushing Jones to the vet for an evaluation, x-rays revealed he’s suffering from a spine vertebra dislocation and a hind leg fracture. Jones immediately received a splint to not only immobilize the fracture to protect it from any further injury but also allowing it to heal by keeping the broken ends together and in alignment. </p>

                        <p>Devi was found roaming the streets very pregnant and suffering from severe skin infection and injuries. No animal, let alone a mother-to-be, should be forced to live this way. Luckily, a good samaritan came across Devi and immediately sought help for this sweet girl.
                        Rescuers immediately arranged transportation to pick her up and bring her to the vet. Once Devi arrived at the vet, she received an evaluation, an overdue bath, and medications to alleviate her infections. After an ultrasound, doctors believe Devi will most likely go into labor in 3-5 days. So, this sweet girl was sent home to foster care to get some much-needed rest before she becomes a mama. </p>
                    <p>
                        After Devi goes into labor, she and her babies will need general vet care. Unfortunately, Indian Pariah (an Indian breed) puppies have a hard time getting adopted, no matter how cute they are because people think they belong on the streets. However, this is far from the case because they deserve nothing more than a warm, loving home. So, rescuers have to plan an effective adoption drive to ensure they get adopted. It is a slow process changing the Indian breed perception, but rescuers are determined to do so.

Their work has seen a critically injured stray mother dog rescued from the streets of India, and flown to the United States within a month, against all odds.</p>
                <P>
                        On the streets of India, dogs are hated like the plague. This discrimination makes people believe that street dogs are non-adoptable. Through some miracles, however, street dogs find a way to survive. </p></div>
